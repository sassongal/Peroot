# 🧠 HIVE MASTER STATE

> **OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL:** This file is the Source of Truth.
> Every Node MUST read this before acting and update it before session end.

## 🎯 CURRENT OBJECTIVE

**Project: Peroot (Prut)**
Building a premium, AI-powered prompt management and enhancement platform. Focusing on advanced refinement logic, persistence with Supabase, and high-end visual aesthetics.

## 🏚️ TECH STACK & CONTEXT

- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS 4.
- **Backend:** Supabase (Auth, DB, SSR), Redis (Upstash) for ratelimiting.
- **AI Integration:** AI SDK (@ai-sdk/google, @ai-sdk/openai), Google Generative AI.
- **Observability:** Sentry for error tracking.
- **State:** Features like Prompt Library, Favorites, and Batch Imports are in various stages of development.

## 📊 ACTIVE NODES & QUOTA

- **Antigravity Nodes (1-7):** Active / Healthy
- **Claude Code:** Running CLI tasks
- **Codex:** Real-time Context Provider

## 🚀 PROGRESS LOG

- **[HIVE-INIT]:** Established Hive Infrastructure (Brain, Registry, Protocols, CLI).
- **[TRANSITION]:** Switched from Flutter-centric to Next.js/Supabase-centric protocols.
- **[DB-OPT]:** Recent work on database optimization and retention policies (Supabase migrations).
- **[UI-UX]:** Shifted focus towards premium design and AI logic refinement.

## ⚠️ PENDING & BLOCKERS

- [Major]: Consolidate the "Master Prompt" across all agent configurations.
- [Next]: Node-1 should perform a deep dive into `src/lib/engines` to audit current AI logic.
- [Note]: Always run `hive lock <file>` before major refactoring.

## 📝 HANDOVER PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

Before ending a session, every Node MUST append to this section:

1. **LAST_ACTION:** Detailed summary of work.
2. **PENDING_LOGIC:** Code left in a partial state.
3. **NEXT_NODE_GOAL:** Clear instruction for the successor.
